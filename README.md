# The Effects of Protein Dynamics on Structure-based Protein Design

MLSB Course Fall 2023 Course Project

In this project, we study how the conformational changes of the input protein structures influence the output sequences of the protein design models. We utilize two protein design models ProteinMPNN and GraDe-IF.
